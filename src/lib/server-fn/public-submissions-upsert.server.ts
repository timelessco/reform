/**
 * Atomic upsert keyed on the partial unique index uniq_submissions_form_id_draft_id
 * (formId, draftId WHERE draftId IS NOT NULL). Replaces a read-then-write that let two
 * concurrent submits both INSERT → unique violation → spurious 500. A CTE captures the
 * pre-write isCompleted (RETURNING only exposes the new row), so callers can still derive the
 * no-downgrade noop and once-only finalize. The CASE no-downgrade guard keeps a completed row
 * completed when a late debounced save arrives with isCompleted=false. Returns the resolved
 * submission id and whether the row was already completed before this write.
