## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd better-form
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Fill in the required values in `.env` (database URL, auth secrets, API keys, etc.).

4. **Set up the database**

   ```bash
   bun db:generate
